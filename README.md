# RhinoMCPServer

A plugin for executing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Rhinoceros. It provides Rhino's functionality as MCP tools and enables efficient communication with MCP clients.

## Overview

This plugin exposes Rhino's functionality to MCP clients using the official [Model Context Protocol C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk). Instead of WebSocket communication, it adopts Server-Sent Events (SSE) to achieve more efficient and lightweight bidirectional communication.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following libraries:

- `RhinoMCPServer.Common`: Common foundation for MCP tools (interfaces, tool management, etc.)
- `RhinoMCPServer.Plugin`: Main Rhino plugin implementation
- `RhinoMCPTools.Basic`: Basic geometry operation tools
- `RhinoMCPTools.Misc`: Utility tools

## Plugin Extensibility

MCP tools are dynamically loaded from DLLs, which means:

- New tools can be added by simply including new DLLs
- Easy addition and removal of plugins
- New tools are automatically recognized upon server restart

## Usage Example
### Drawing from Sketch & Attribute Information Assignment
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eaae01c-27b7-4d4f-961f-a4c1ad64ff7f

## System Requirements

- Rhino 9 WIP
- .NET 8.0 Runtime

## How to Use

### Starting the MCP Server

1. Enter `StartMCPServer` in Rhino's command line
2. Port number configuration
   - Default: 3001 (automatically used when pressing Enter)
   - Custom: Any port number can be entered
3. After server startup, it waits for MCP client connections on the specified port

### Connecting with MCP Clients

Currently, Claude Desktop's MCP client does not directly support SSE connections, so you need to use the [MCP server that bridges standard I/O to SSE](https://github.com/boilingdata/mcp-server-and-gw).

## Provided MCP Tools
